# Replit AI Prompt — Simplify Post-Swipe “Trade Placed” Pop-Up (Smaller, Less Text, Still Clear)

You already have full repo context. The current post-swipe pop-up is too large and text-heavy. Redesign it into a **compact toast / mini-modal** that covers minimal screen space while still making the key concepts obvious.

## Core UX goals (must be understood in ~2 seconds)
1) What did I buy? (side + whole shares)
2) What did it cost? (total spent)
3) Where did leftover wager go? (stays in balance)
Everything else must be hidden behind a single “Details” tap.

# A) New Compact Layout (default view)

## Component style
- Small bottom sheet or compact modal (max ~25–30% of screen height)
- One primary line + 2 secondary lines + 1 small hint line
- No paragraphs

## Default content (no “details” expanded)
**Title:** Trade placed

**Primary line (big):**
**Bought {N} {YES/NO} share(s)**

**Secondary lines (small):**
- **Spent:** ${spent} (of ${wager})
- **Left in balance:** ${leftover}

**Tiny hint (muted):**
“Whole shares only.”  (with an ⓘ icon)

Buttons:
- Primary: **Done**
- Secondary: **Details** (chevron / expands inline)

Notes:
- Remove “buy price”, “payout if wins”, “selling uses sell price”, and “processing on-chain” from the default view.
- Keep “Processing…” as a tiny spinner badge only if you truly need it (optional).

# B) Details (expand/collapse on tap)

When user taps **Details**, expand just enough to show 3 extra rows:

- **Buy price:** {ask}¢
- **Shares:** {N} (whole shares)
- **Potential payout:** ${payoutIfWin}  (optional; only if you think it adds confidence)

Add a *single* one-liner at the bottom:
“Sell price may differ.” (ⓘ tooltip: “Markets have a buy and sell price.”)

No more than **4 rows** in expanded mode.

---

# C) Microcopy (exact strings)

Title:
- “Trade placed”

Primary:
- “Bought {N} {YES/NO} share{plural}”

Secondary:
- “Spent ${spent} of ${wager}”
- “Left in balance: ${leftover}”

Hint tooltip (on “Whole shares only”):
- “We can only buy whole shares. Any unused amount stays in your balance.”

Sell tooltip (optional):
- “You sell at the current sell price, which can be different from the buy price.”

---

# D) Behavior rules

1) If leftover is $0.00, hide the “Left in balance” line.
2) If sharesBought == 0 (wager too low), do NOT show the trade placed pop-up:
   - Show compact error toast:
     “Wager too low to buy 1 share at {ask}¢. Increase wager.”
3) If the trade is async:
   - Show a small “Submitting…” / “Processing…” badge (not a full line of text).

---

# E) Engineering requirements

- Use the existing data you already compute:
  - side (YES/NO)
  - sharesBought (int)
  - spent
  - wager
  - leftover
  - askPrice (optional for Details)
  - payoutIfWin (optional)

- Ensure the component is responsive and does not cover more than ~30% height in default state.

# Deliverables
1) Replace the current large post-swipe modal with this compact version.
2) Add “Details” expand/collapse.
3) Ensure text + spacing fits small screens.
