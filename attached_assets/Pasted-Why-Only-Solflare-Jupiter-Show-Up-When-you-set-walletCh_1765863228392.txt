Why Only Solflare & Jupiter Show Up

When you set walletChainType to 'solana-only', Privy will filter wallet options based on:

The walletChainType you pass to connectWallet or in your config, and

The external Solana connectors you’ve configured.

By default, Privy does not automatically include Solana connectors — unlike EVM wallets, which just work — so if you have not configured Solana connectors, it will only show wallets that Privy can detect using basic injected providers (like Solflare and Jupiter mobile in-app browser detection) and nothing else. 
docs.privy.io

This is why your modal shows only:

Solflare

Jupiter

These are showing because Privy detects them in your environment, but other wallets (Phantom, Backpack, etc.) are not configured yet, so Privy does not include them.

What You Need to Do to Support All Solana Wallets

To get all Solana wallets (like Phantom, Backpack, etc.) to show under Solana only, you must do two things:

1. Configure Solana Connectors in Privy Provider

Import and initialize the Solana wallet connectors using Privy’s helper:

import { PrivyProvider } from '@privy-io/react-auth';
import { toSolanaWalletConnectors } from '@privy-io/react-auth/solana';

<PrivyProvider
  appId="your-privy-app-id"
  config={{
    appearance: {
      walletChainType: 'ethereum-and-solana',  // or 'solana-only'
      // walletList: optional custom ordering
    },
    externalWallets: {
      solana: { connectors: toSolanaWalletConnectors() }
    }
  }}
>
  {children}
</PrivyProvider>


Privy’s toSolanaWalletConnectors() sets up all the standard Solana wallet adapters so Privy knows how to request connections for Phantom, Backpack, etc. 
docs.privy.io

2. Set walletChainType Appropriately

When calling connectWallet, you may pass:

connectWallet({
  walletChainType: 'solana-only',
  walletList: ['detected_solana_wallets'] // optional custom list
});


Or define in your provider:

appearance: { walletChainType: 'solana-only' }


This ensures the modal is filtered only for Solana wallets. 
docs.privy.io

If you need both Solana and EVM wallets in some contexts, set:

appearance: { walletChainType: 'ethereum-and-solana' }

Why It Matters

Privy doesn’t automatically hook Solana wallets like it does for EVM wallets unless you expressly configure them via toSolanaWalletConnectors() — so without that, only a few automatically detected Solana wallets show.

Example Full Setup (React)
import { PrivyProvider } from '@privy-io/react-auth';
import { toSolanaWalletConnectors } from '@privy-io/react-auth/solana';

function App({ children }) {
  return (
    <PrivyProvider
      appId="your-privy-app-id"
      config={{
        appearance: {
          walletChainType: 'solana-only',
          walletList: [
            'detected_solana_wallets',
            'phantom',
            'solflare',
            'backpack',
            'jupiter',
            'wallet_connect' // optional to catch WalletConnect compatible
          ]
        },
        externalWallets: {
          solana: { connectors: toSolanaWalletConnectors() }
        }
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </PrivyProvider>
  );
}


This will ensure all standard Solana wallets can show and connect.
